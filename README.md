## When to Use CancellationToken

### Long-Running Operations

`CancellationToken` is invaluable when dealing with operations that might take a considerable amount of time to complete. By allowing users to interrupt or cancel such operations, you enhance the overall user experience.

### Parallel Processing

In scenarios involving parallel operations, such as parallel loops or Task Parallel Library (TPL) tasks, `CancellationToken` provides a consistent and reliable way to cancel these parallel tasks gracefully.

### Asynchronous Operations

When making asynchronous calls, especially to external services or APIs, incorporating `CancellationToken` allows your application to handle cancellations gracefully, preventing unnecessary resource utilization.

## Usage and Benefits of CancellationToken

### Graceful Cancellation

`CancellationToken` ensures that ongoing operations are terminated gracefully, preventing abrupt disruptions and potential resource leaks.

### Responsive Applications

By incorporating `CancellationToken`, you enhance the responsiveness of your applications. Users can interrupt time-consuming operations, making the application more user-friendly.

### Error Handling

The `OperationCanceledException` thrown upon cancellation provides a structured way to handle and log cancellations, facilitating error diagnosis and resolution.

### Consistent API Design

When designing APIs, incorporating `CancellationToken` provides a consistent pattern for handling cancellations. It aligns with the principles of cooperative cancellation across different parts of your application.
